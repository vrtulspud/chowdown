This classic beef stew is given a twist with the addition of flavorful shiitake mushrooms. If shiitake mushrooms are unavailable, substitute other mushrooms of your choice. For extra punch, add a few dried porcini mushrooms to the stew.

You may double the amount of meat, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, onion, and celery for the 5, 6, or 7-quart Crock-Pot slow cooker.
