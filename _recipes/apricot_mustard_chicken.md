The piquancy of the spices is tempered by the sweetness of the apricot juice... a perfect combination to highlight the chicken breasts. For a 5, 6, or 7-quart Crock-Pot slow cooker, double all ingredients. When reheating, add cut up, fresh apricots. May substitute 4 cups prepared couscous for wild rice.
