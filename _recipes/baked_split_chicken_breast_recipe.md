ingredients:
- 2 large bone-in chicken breast halves (with or without skin)
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic (minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano




directions:
- 1) Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, basil, thyme, and oregano.
- 2) Arrange chicken in a large baking dish and refrigerate at least 45 minutes.
- 3) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
- 4) Bake in preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).

Instead of measuring out the spices and sprinkling over the chicken, I place the chicken in a glass baking dish and sprinkle the spices over both sides of the chicken, one after another. Stupid simple and quick prep. The original recipe calls for chicken with skin, but I find the chicken without skin works fine, and the spices create their own skin over the meat.
