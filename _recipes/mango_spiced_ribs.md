For the 5, 6 or 7-quart Crock-Pot slow cooker, you may double all ingredients.

I did NOT add the 1/2 tsp of salt. I used London Pub Major Grey Chutney, as it was the only one on the shelf with no bell peppers and with sugar instead of HFCS. This chutney has 105mg of sodium for a Tbsp, and you use the whole jar, so I'd say that extra 1/2 tsp of salt is hardly needed. I also don't know where they got 12-15 servings, but I never understand how they reach their numbers.

It's good, it stayed moist, the meat was fall off the bone awesomeness, and it's something novel. The only con was, really, that I'd prefer a lower sodium content, so I'll be on the lookout for other applicable mango chutneys to use with this one, as I'd like to give it a go again.
