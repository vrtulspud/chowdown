ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon Butter (or coconut oil)
- 1 onion (finely chopped)
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- 2 celery ribs (chopped)
- 2 Carrots (chopped)
- 1/4 large red bell pepper (chopped, optional)
- 1 1/2 cup Water (or more to thin)
- 2 cans black beans (rinsed and drained)
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt (plus more to taste, optional)
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 lemon (juiced)



directions:
- 1) In a large stock pot over medium-high heat, cook the chopped onion, carrots, celery, garlic and red pepper in a pat of butter or coconut oil for about 10 minutes, until tender.
- 2) Transfer the cooked vegetables to a high-speed blender, and add in the water and 1/2 a can of black beans. Process until a smooth puree is formed.
- 3) Return the puree to the stock pot over medium-high heat, and add the remaining black beans, cumin, salt and lemon juice. If you'd like a thinner soup, feel free to add a bit more water, and any additional seasoning, to taste.
- 4) Serve piping hot, with a dollop of fresh salsa on top.

This soup is the perfect meal on a chilly evening. It’s based on the tasty version served at Panera Bread. Loaded with fiber-rich black beans, this soup is not only comforting, it’s also incredibly filling.

Original recipe calls for red bell pepper and salt, which I omit.
