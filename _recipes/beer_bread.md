**Substitutions**
Sugar – Naturally sweeten with 1/4 cup honey.
Beer – Guinness, IPA, Farmhouse Ale, Pale Ale, Brown Ale, Belgian. You can use lighter beers as well, but they’ll offer less flavor.
Minced Garlic – You can use fresh minced garlic, but I always use minced garlic purchased in the produce section of the grocery store. 
Butter – I always use salted butter in all of my bread recipes, but if you don’t use salted butter, add a little salt. 
**Variations**
Add Cheese – Aged cheeses tend to work well with honey. Add 1 cup of freshly shredded parmesan, gruyere or cheddar to make a sweet and savory cheesy beer bread.
Add Herbs – Fold 1 tablespoon dried rosemary, thyme or sage into the batter just before baking.
Add Salt – Just before serving, brush the loaf with warm honey butter and use a grinder to add thick flakes of sea salt.
Make into Beer Muffins – While I like to use a classic loaf pan, you can also make it in a muffin tin for individual portions! Just reduce baking time.
**Store**
At Room Temperature – Covered in plastic wrap or in a ziplock bag up to 3 days.
Refrigerated – Covered in plastic wrap or in a ziplock up to 5 days. It will soften the crust and add to the beer flavor.
Freeze – Freeze covered in plastic wrap or foil and place in a freezer bag to prevent freezer odors from seeping in up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before serving.
