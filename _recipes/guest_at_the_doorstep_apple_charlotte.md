ingredients:
- Butter
- Breadcrumbs, Unflavored
- 6 large Apples, Tart (Granny Smith)
- 1 teaspoon Cinnamon, Ground
- 3 Eggs, Large
- 1 cup less 1 Tbsp Sugar, White
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
- 1 1/2 cup Flour, Unbleached All-purpose


directions:
- 1) Butter a 9-inch springform pan and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.
- 2) Toss apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, or ground cloves, if desired.
- 3) Add the apples to the pan; they should fill the pan completely.
- 4) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
- 5) With an electric mixer or wire whisk, beat the eggs with the sugar until the mixture is smooth and pale yellow and forms a ribbon when the beaters are lifted. Beat in the vanilla extract.
- 6) Gradually beat in the flour. You will have a rather thick batter.
- 7) Pour the batter evenly into the pan over the apples. The batter and apples should be level.
- 8) Bake until the top of the charlotte is puffy and golden, about 50-55 minutes. Serve at room temperature.

This is excellent when eaten warm, but do let cool it for 30 minutes or so. Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar before serving.
