From the original recipe: "The secret to the success of this recipe is to make sure that both the chicken and yogurt are very cold (hence, soaking the chicken in the ice water). The preliminary soaking will help the breading adhere and produce a crisp coating much like that fried chicken. If you're serving the chicken on a platter rather than on individual dinner plates, it looks smashing on a bed of flowering kale. Makes 12 pieces."

Used to make this using chiken breasts, but I've found that chicken tenderloins work best and are fun too.
